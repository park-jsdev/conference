The rise of Computational Intelligence (CI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in biomedical and healthcare data analysis has led to significant advancements in cancer genomics, identifying new biomarkers and personalizing treatment strategies through vast genomic data processing. However, AI's integration into clinical settings is hindered by its opaque, "black-box" nature, which lacks transparency in decision-making. This poses a challenge for clinicians needing understandable, trustworthy AI recommendations. The student competition aims to address this by encouraging the development of Explainable AI (XAI) models that not only predict drug responses accurately but also provide clear, interpretable explanations. This competition seeks to bridge AI research with clinical practice, enhancing clinician confidence and patient outcomes through transparent, explainable AI solutions.
